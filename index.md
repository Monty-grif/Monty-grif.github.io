I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in fall of 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    This was a fun lab for me because it was the first time I actually coded something in a terminal besides messing around. Changing a computer program to say my name was very cool to see. I had to learn how to use cin and cout at first but once we figured that out it was a pretty smooth lab. 

* Lab 8 , part 2

    It was very interesting to see the pattern that was created by thethe lines and asterisk in a simple for loop with a pattern. There were some debugging issues with getting the correct amount of lines and stars to be output for thethe test. But it was only small problems like making sure the for loop stopped at the right place so the test would pass. 

* Lab 9, part 2

    This was a lab that ended up being a little troubling for me but at the same time, it was pretty fun. Making the code for a game to guess a secret number would be very satisfying and fun to look at after the program was completed. This lab involved ifstream and input files which I hadnâ€™t worked on before so that is something that I learned a lot about during this part of lab 9 with both my partner and the instructor for class.
